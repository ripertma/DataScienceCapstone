To find the perfect spot for a juicy business on the pizza planet, I intend to exploit the possibilities 
given by Foursquare API by following these steps:

1.	Collect the venues data of the whole city (not just restaurants but all venues) by using Foursquare

2.	Collect the localization of the 80 neighbourhoods of Paris

3.	Classify the venues among their respective neighbourhoods

4.	Cluster the neighbourhoods with the k-nearest method : Several values of k will be tested to retain 
the maximal value of k for which every cluster contains at least two neighbourhoods

5.	Analyse the data and identify the cluster which matches our targeted market (“trendy” means there 
are a lot of restaurants, bars, cultural life …)  

6.	In this cluster, select the half of the neighbourhoods which concentrate the most trending venues at night
(a Foursquare request will be used to identify the trendy places)

7.	In this selection of neighbourhoods, identify the one with the least Italian restaurants
