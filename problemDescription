Description of the problem

Italian restaurants are at the moment very trendy places in Paris: a lot of concept restaurants which propose 
Italian cuisine have recently opened in the city and compete to propose the most authentic experience of what 
an Italian “Trattoria” should be: affordable prices, Italian cooks and waiters, authentic decoration.  
For instance, to get a chance to dine at the well-named “Popolare” you must first queue outside for sometimes 
hours (even in winter). 

Let’s say that I am getting rid of this silly idea of working in data science and that I would like to open 
such a restaurant in Paris. The question is: in which area of the city should I open my restaurant to maximize
my chances of success? 

•	As there are already many restaurants of this kind, I first want to make sure not to open my business in 
a saturated zone

•	Yet, installing my restaurant in a residential area will not help me that much, as nobody would come by: 
it needs to be in some trendy area!

•	A further requirement is that I would like to open just for dinner : people are stressed and in a hurry 
at lunch, while I want to propose some slow food experience (concepts like that sell very well) 

In short, I want to find the evening-trendy place of Paris where there are the least Italian restaurants to open my restaurant.
